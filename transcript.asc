The Muninn project is an academic research project creating Linked Open Data
from First World War Archival, Library and Museums sources.  The aim is to
take digitized documents, extract the data using computing power and turn
that information into structured Linked Open Data that is published under a
creative commons license and a part of the Linked Open Data Cloud. 
Inter-Linked to other well known Linked Open Data Cloud datasets such as
Linked Geo Data, Geonames and Dbpedia, Muninn data can then support further
historical and semantic web research by providing real-world information in
a format that is easy to access through URLs, data dumps and a SPARQL
server.

Some of the current questions that the Muninn team has been working on is
how to consume historical Linked Open Data with tools other than graphs and
spreadsheets.  One solution that we are presenting here are as objects in
virtual worlds.

Books surround us and are everyday cultural heritage objects. With the
availability of large amounts of digitized books with linked open data
cataloging data, the instantiation of their contents within a virtual world
is straightforward.

The content of the books themselves can be displayed within the virtual
world.  Here, The Count of Monte Cristo, a 1834 novel by Alexandre Dumas, is
randomly left on a house table for visitors to peruse.

Since Linked Open Data gives us the ability to locate books based on year,
language, culture or context, their automated insertion into historical
scenes is possible without creating an historical anachronisms.  Hence, this
copy of The Three Musketeers would not appear in a simulation dated earlier
than 1844, the year of the first publication of the work.

This allows the creation of opportunities for the serendipitous discovery of
new relevant books to the context of the simulation without incurring the
programming overhead normally required to do.

Social Networks data about the owners of objects can also be used to further
enrich the world in ways that are contextually appropriate.

Only a limited subset of the creative works curated by a Museums are on
display at any given time.  Works by lesser known artists are not always
given the attention they deserve nor do exhibitions cater to all tastes. 
Through the use of Linked Open Data API that are provided by some Museums
such as the Rijksmuseum creating specialized, thematic or genre specific
virtual exhibits is straightforward.  It also allows for the serendipitous
use of creative works in virtual environments for an increased realism while
communicating the esthetic of a certain historical period.

We can push this approach further by using the content of other Museums,
such as the Cooper–Hewitt Smithsonian Design Museum, to programmatically
theme the generic elements of virtual locations with the styles appropriate
to an era.

The Muninn project has created linked open data sets of Central and Allied
trenches over the western front extracted from original trench maps of the
period using image processing algorithms.  The availability of online linked
open data maps catalogues enables the automated generation of this data and
its visualizations in 3D virtual worlds.  This allows us to experience
locations that no longer exist and enrich scholarly study of past events.

Ontologies such as the Muninn Graves ontology record the location of graves
in different cimeteries.  Their coupling to existing data sets and
visualizaiton engines can show the evolution of a cemetery and the
location of unmarked graves.  The Fort Massey Cemetery has been in Halifax
since the 1750. It contains the graves of soldiers from different
eras, not all of which have a grave makers.  Temporally enabled linked open
data makes it possible to visualised the same data set at different
times to plan an archelogical dig, research an ancestors’s grave or navigate
the modern day cemetary. 

As an open format, Linked Open Data can be used for different applications.
Here, triples about the Battle of Vimy Ridge that occurred during the great
war are used to create a solid model of the battlefield that can be 3D
printed.  This specific piece is a representation of the eastern slope of
Vimy Ridge in 1917 with German communication trenches clearly visible. 
While the printing raised-relief maps in not new, the use of linked open
data to print features such as trenches that no longer exists is a novel way
of experiencing lost heritage sites.

The inherent power of Linked Open Data, and BIG Linked Open Data, is the
ability to derive value from data that would otherwise be discarded as
useless.  This plot shows the details of Royal Navy ships tracks during WW1
as derived from the Zoom Universe old weather data set.  While the Old
Weather focuses on transcription projects and Muninn on the First World War,
neither are experts on weather data and the quality of the weather data
remains undocumented.

The W3 Sensor Ontology allows us to link the ship’s tracks with their
weather observations as well as the original sensing instrument.  In this
case an instance of the original barometer / thermometer combination
instrument is available at the National Maritime museum in Greenwich.  Not
on display, the existence of the artifact would not normally be known if not
for the museum API.

Linked Open Data makes the data not only available but documents it in a way
that is useful to climate scientists, who care about the process used to
record the weather data, naval historians who care about the documented
proof of the position of the ships and to cultural heritage curators who
about the underlying documents and artifacts from which all of the
information flows.

In the coming year Muninn will continue generating GIS data about the Great
War and working on novel data consumption approaches.  Two applications of
interest are the use of Great War maps and aerial pictures to create
unexploded ordnance risk maps and data extracted from the personal letters
of Great War soldiers to extract social network information in a manner
similar to the Linked Jazz Project.
